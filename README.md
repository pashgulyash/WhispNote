Hi! I am new to coding and this is my first app. Initially I wanted to make it for Windows Mobile 10 but I couldn't because of GitHub restrictions.

The 1.0 version of the app contains almost nothing and is probably just a stub to test the GitHub environment.

So far I haven't figured out what is done here and how, so version 1.0 and subsequent versions of the application will be duplicated on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-0mlF61HNO3QGjRKRi-LjTXIC5BmofiR
